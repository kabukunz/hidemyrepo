FORENSIC PDF STEGANOGRAPHY SUITE - FEATURE & FUNCTION MAPPING
================================================================================

--- 1. CORE ENGINE (pdf_hide.py) ------------------------------------------------

[Robust Password Generation]
Function: generate_robust_password()
Description: Generates 32-character, high-entropy session keys using the 
'secrets' module for cryptographic security.

[Memory-Resident Compression]
Function: get_zip_memory()
Description: Aggregates and compresses the source payload into a ZIP archive 
entirely within RAM (io.BytesIO) to prevent temporary disk leaks.

[Symmetric Stream Encryption]
Function: xor_crypt()
Description: Implements a cyclical XOR cipher using the session password to 
secure the compressed payload buffer.

[Proportional Sharding & Injection]
Function: hide()
Description: The primary logic for calculating proportional distribution, 
performing the capacity check, filtering banned carriers, and appending shards 
past the %%EOF marker.

[Restoration & Reassembly]
Function: restore()
Description: Reads the manifest, extracts appended data from selected carriers, 
decrypts the stream, and decompresses the payload back to the disk.

[Session Persistence]
Functions: save_session() / load_session()
Description: Manages the storage and retrieval of the session password and 
carrier order list (manifest) to ensure reliable recovery.

[Integrity Verification]
Functions: get_file_hash() / hash_check()
Description: Generates and compares SHA-256 hashes for every file to ensure 
the restored data is bit-perfect.

[Visual Feedback]
Function: draw_progress()
Description: Renders high-fidelity ASCII progress bars to the terminal during 
heavy I/O or compression operations.


--- 2. METADATA FORGERY (pdf_sync.py) ------------------------------------------

[Deep Metadata Extraction]
Function: get_meta()
Description: Uses macOS-specific 'stat' flags and 'xattr' commands to extract 
Birth, Modification, Access, and 'Date Added' metadata.

[macOS Metadata Mirroring]
Function: sync()
Description: The core forgery engine. Strips system locks (chflags), mirrors 
Extended Attributes (xattr), and uses the macOS kernel (libc.setattrlist) to 
forge Creation/Birth dates.

[Forensic Reporting]
Function: audit()
Description: Performs a side-by-side comparison of original vs. modified 
carriers across four critical forensic points to verify stealth.


--- 3. PIPELINE CONTROLLER (cycle_test.py) -------------------------------------

[Lifecycle Orchestration]
Function: run_pipeline()
Description: Automates the sequence of events: cleaning the environment, 
triggering the hide, syncing metadata, auditing, and verifying restoration.

[Environment Sanitation]
Function: cleanup()
Description: Recursively removes temporary directories and session files to 
ensure no forensic traces are left behind after a testing cycle.

[Sorted File Retrieval]
Function: get_sorted_files() (Imported from pdf_hide)
Description: Ensures that file processing order is deterministic across 
different stages of the pipeline.
